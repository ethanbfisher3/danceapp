Ideas needed for app to be completed:

Sort custom moves by styles
Fix the timing on moves, allowing the user to select certain timings if the moves has different endings
Moves that are specific endings should be called ending moves or something
Counts for each move
Figure out what to do for moves that aren't showed in one video because they're already in another video
Images for the app (app image on Expo Go)



Counts for ALL American Rhythm styles except cha cha, International Foxtrot (all levels), Silver and Gold International cha cha, International samba (all levels), International Jive (all levels)


Ideas for afterwards:

Somehow allow the user to connect a song to a routine and mark where certain parts, whether faster or slower, are in the song
Men's vs Women's moves
Website like ndca for country swing dancing moves?
Have a random routine generator
Add timestamps for uploaded videos
When adding your own video, you should be able to automatically load in the timestamps and save the ones you like
Make moves for those that are their own moves but the videos show multiple (ex. Fregolina and Farol)
Recommended moves based on a current orientation
